This package enables GELF logging via TCP, UDP, HTTP or STOMP.

All credits go to the [original package](https://github.com/hedii/laravel-gelf-logger).

as a Laravel service provider, so no additional actions are required.

## Setup

## Usage

### Example

# Extending the package

Publishing the configuration will enable you to change package models as
well as controlling how migrations behave. If extending the model, make sure
you're extending the original model in your implementation.
